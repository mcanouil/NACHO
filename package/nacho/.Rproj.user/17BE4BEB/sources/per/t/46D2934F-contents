\usage{
normalize(summary, housekeep = "", remove.outliers = T, norm = "GEO")
}
\arguments{
\item{summary}{Summary of analyzed nanoString nCounter RCC files.}

\item{housekeep}{Vector with the names of the housekeeping genes. When no input is given,
the default housekeeping genes are used.}

\item{remove.outliers}{Logical indicator if outliers ought to be removed before size factor
calculation and normalization. If outliers are not removed, the the calculated size factors
from summarize will be used.}

\item{norm}{A string indicating which form of calculation needs to be performed:
"GEO" or "GLM"}
}
\value{
A list containing the raw counts as data frame, normalized counts as data frame and
normalization factors as dataframe.
}
\description{
Calculates sample specific size factors and normalizes
nanoString nCounter RCC files.
