Description: NACHO (NanoString Quality Control Dashboard) is developed for NanoString nCounter data. 
    NanoString nCounter data are gene expression assays where there is no need for the use of enzymes 
    or amplification protocols and work with fluorescent barcodes. 
    Each barcode is assigned a mRNA/miRNA which after bonding with its target can be counted. 
    As a result each count of a specific barcode represents the presence of its target mRNA/miRNA.  
    NACHO is able to analyse the exported NanoString nCounter data and facilitates 
    the user in performing a quality control.  
    NACHO does this by visualising Quality Control metrics, expression of control genes, 
    principal components and sample specific size factors in an interactive web application.
