Description: NanoString nCounter data are gene expression assays
    where there is no need for the use of enzymes or amplification
    protocols and work with fluorescent barcodes (Geiss et al. (2018)
    <doi:10.1038/nbt1385>).  Each barcode is assigned a
    messenger-RNA/micro-RNA (mRNA/miRNA) which after bonding with its
    target can be counted.  As a result each count of a specific barcode
    represents the presence of its target mRNA/miRNA.  'NACHO' (NAnoString
    quality Control dasHbOard) is able to analyse the exported NanoString
    nCounter data and facilitates the user in performing a quality
    control.  'NACHO' does this by visualising quality control metrics,
    expression of control genes, principal components and sample specific
    size factors in an interactive web application.
