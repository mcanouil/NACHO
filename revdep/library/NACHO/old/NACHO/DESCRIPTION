Description: NanoString nCounter data are gene expression assays where there is no need for the use of enzymes 
    or amplification protocols and work with fluorescent barcodes (Geiss et al. (2018) <doi:10.1038/nbt1385>). 
    Each barcode is assigned a messenger-RNA/micro-RNA (mRNA/miRNA) which after bonding with its target can be counted. 
    As a result each count of a specific barcode represents the presence of its target mRNA/miRNA.  
    'NACHO' (NAnoString quality Control dasHbOard) is able to analyse the exported NanoString nCounter 
    data and facilitates the user in performing a quality control.  
    'NACHO' does this by visualising quality control metrics, expression of control genes, 
    principal components and sample specific size factors in an interactive web application.
