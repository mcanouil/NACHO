	abstract = {{PAM}50 intrinsic breast cancer subtypes are prognostic independent of standard clinicopathologic factors. {CALGB} 9741 demonstrated improved recurrence-free ({RFS}) and overall survival ({OS}) with 2-weekly dose-dense ({DD}) versus 3-weekly therapy. A significant interaction between intrinsic subtypes and {DD}-therapy benefit was hypothesized. Suitable tumor samples were available from 1,471 (73\%) of 2,005 subjects. Multiplexed gene-expression profiling generated the {PAM}50 subtype call, proliferation score, and risk of recurrence score ({ROR}-{PT}) for the evaluable subset of 1,311 treated patients. The interaction between {DD}-therapy benefit and intrinsic subtype was tested in a Cox proportional hazards model using two-sided alpha=0.05. Additional multivariable Cox models evaluated the proliferation and {ROR}-{PT} scores as continuous measures with selected clinical covariates. Improved outcomes for {DD} therapy in the evaluable subset mirrored results from the complete data set ({RFS}; hazard ratio=1.20; 95\% confidence interval=0.99–1.44) with 12.3-year median follow-up. Intrinsic subtypes were prognostic of {RFS} (P{\textless}0.0001) irrespective of treatment assignment. No subtype-specific treatment effect on {RFS} was identified (interaction P=0.44). Proliferation and {ROR}-{PT} scores were prognostic for {RFS} (both P{\textless}0.0001), but no association with treatment benefit was seen (P=0.14 and 0.59, respectively). Results were similar for {OS}. The prognostic value of {PAM}50 intrinsic subtype was greater than estrogen receptor/{HER}2 immunohistochemistry classification. {PAM}50 gene signatures were highly prognostic but did not predict for improved outcomes with {DD} anthracycline- and taxane-based therapy. Clinical validation studies will assess the ability of {PAM}50 and other gene signatures to stratify patients and individualize treatment based on expected risks of distant recurrence.},

	abstract = {We describe a technology, the {NanoString} {nCounter} gene expression system, which captures and counts individual {mRNA} transcripts. Advantages over existing platforms include direct measurement of {mRNA} expression levels without enzymatic reactions or bias, sensitivity coupled with high multiplex capability, and digital readout. Experiments performed on 509 human genes yielded a replicate correlation coefficient of 0.999, a detection limit between 0.1 {fM} and 0.5 {fM}, and a linear dynamic range of over 500-fold. Comparison of the {NanoString} {nCounter} gene expression system with microarrays and {TaqMan} {PCR} demonstrated that the {nCounter} system is more sensitive than microarrays and similar in sensitivity to real-time {PCR}. Finally, a comparison of transcript levels for 21 genes across seven samples measured by the {nCounter} system and {SYBR} Green real-time {PCR} demonstrated similar patterns of gene expression at all transcript levels.},
